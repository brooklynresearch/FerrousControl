# FerrousControl
Ferrofluid controlled through an electromagnetic array

## python
This folder contains all the algorithms and code to send to the electromagnetic array.

## embedded
This folder contains all the design files and embedded code for the electromagentic controller boards.
These basically received USB Serial messages from the main computer, parse that information to the proper board, and translate those messages to the electromagnets.
