# FerrousControl
Ferrofluid controlled through an electromagnetic array

## COMMS
Requirements:
- Python 3.6.2
- PySerial
- [Robust Serial Library](https://github.com/araffin/arduino-robust-serial)

## PYTHON
- steps variable in snake effectively changes speed with fewer steps being fater
- framerate also adjusts speed but for everything at once

## Startup
- java -jar /Users/newhumans/Documents/GitHub/FerrousControl/COMMS/PYTHON/nstokes_2_40x46/processing-py.jar /Users/newhumans/Documents/GitHub/FerrousControl/COMMS/PYTHON/nstokes_2_40x46/nstokes_2_40x46.pyde
- above was done as part of a Utilities Automator script that starts on login
